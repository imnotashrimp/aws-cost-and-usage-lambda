## Overview
 
This AWS Lambda function collects AWS Cost and Usage reports and sends them to Logz.io in bulk, over HTTP. For more snapshots and explanations you can visit our blog [here](https://logz.io/blog/aws-cost-usage-report-1/).

## Prerequisite
Before you follow the steps below please make sure you configured AWS to generate a report to a target S3 bucket. If you 
are not sure how to do it, please refer to this [post](https://logz.io/blog/aws-cost-usage-report-1/).
**Important!** AWS Lambda can run for up to 15 minutes with up to 3008MB, and the process time for the whole report must end within this timeframe.


## Step 1 - Create a new lambda 
1. Sign in to your AWS account and open the AWS Lambda console.
2. Click **Create function**, to create a new Lambda function.
3. Select Author from scratch, and enter the following information:
  - Name -  Enter a name for your new Lambda function. We suggest adding the log type to the name.
  - Runtime - From the drop-down menu, select Python 2.7 as the functionâ€™s runtime.
  - Role - Make sure to add the following policy to your Lambda:
    ```   
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "s3:Get*",
                    "s3:List*"
                ],
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }   
    ```
    Hit the **Create Function** button in the bottom-right corner of the page.
    
## Step 2 - Uploading and configuring the Logz.io Lambda shipper
1. Download 'lambda_function.py' and 'shipper.py' from *src* folder and zip them using the following: 
 `zip logzio-cost-and-usage-shipper lambda_function.py shipper.py`
2. In the Function Code section, open the Code entry type menu, and select *Upload a .ZIP file*.
3. Select the zip you created.
4. Set the following:
  - TOKEN: Your Logz.io account token. Can be retrieved on the Settings page in the Logz.io UI.
  - URL: The Logz.io listener URL. If you are in the EU region insert https://listener-eu.logz.io:8071. Otherwise, use https://listener.logz.io:8071. You can tell which region you are in by checking your login URL - *app.logz.io* means you are in the US. *app-eu.logz.io* means you are in the EU.
  - REPORT_NAME: *See below picture where can you take it from*
  - REPORT_PATH: *See below picture where can you take it from*
  - S3_BUCKET_NAME: *See below picture where can you take it from* 
5. In the Basic Settings section, we recommend to start by setting memory to 1024(MB) and a 5(MIN) timeout, and then subsequently adjusting these values based on trial and error, and according to your Lambda usage.
6. Leave the other settings as default report fields

## Step 3 - Setting scheduling trigger
1. Under Add triggers at the top of the page, select the CloudWatch event trigger.
2. In the Configure triggers section, select 'Create a new rule' and enter the 'Rule Name' and 'Rule Description'. 
3. Under 'Rule type' select 'Schedule expression', and in the 'Schedule expression' tab enter your report shipping rate.
Notice that AWS publish report updates up to three times a day so there is no need to set the rate too frequently.
We recommend to start with 10 hour rate: `rate(10 hours)`
4. Click **Add** to add the trigger and **Save** at the top of the page to save all your configurations.
